## Cat
Cat is a simple but not crude blog theme for hugo. [Demo](https://poems.gq)
> It's port of the [Kilerd/Cat](https://github.com/Kilerd/Cat), and I make some changes.

## Usage



## Feature

- **H1~H6 Title**  
  As you see, cat only supoort three kinds of titles: h1, h2~h3, h4~h6.  
  "Why i do this?I support that an article should be short and clean, dont let visitors spend much time to recognise the blog post structure." Designer pingdog
